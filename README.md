# PlayerCount-Bot

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/14fbc6efc2b7292f0211/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/reasonablenewman/PlayerCount-Bot/maintainability)

A discord bot for seeing a games player count using steam's web api. Written in python.

All you need to do to use it is install all the requirements then create a file called "token.txt" (that needs to contain your bot's token) in the same folder as the bot.py file. Then you just run the bot.


**PS:** You cannot install the required version of discord.py through the "requirements.txt" file so you need to run "pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py"
