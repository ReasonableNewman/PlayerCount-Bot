# PlayerCount-Bot
A discord bot for seeing a games player count using steam's web api. Written in python.

All you need to do to use it is to create a file called "token.txt" in the same folder as the bot.py file. Then you just run the bot.

PS: You cannot install the required version of discord.py through the "requirements.txt" file so you need to run "pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py"
